course-project-team-10 LOG - Commit 1: Div, Hamiz, and Justin worked on creating the database to store transactions. We created a person, income, and spending class. The income and spending class will be stored in a dictionary in the person class along with functions to access the income and spending class. Abhi set up the react and flask architecture and used the functions the team created to make a simple flask application and a react front end.
